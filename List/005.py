'''
Create a script that does the same thing as the pop method for a list containing only characters. 
The difference is that this function displays a message indicating the number of characters that are 
identical to the deleted character and still remain in the string. In other words, if there were 3 "b" in the list, 
and one has just been deleted by your function, the script will display "there are still 2 letters b".
